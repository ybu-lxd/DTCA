# Precipitation Nowcasting Using Diffusion Transformer with Causal Attention


Short-term precipitation forecasting remains chal- lenging due to the difficulty in capturing long-term spatiotem- poral dependencies. Current deep learning methods fall short in establishing effective dependencies between conditions and forecast results, while also lacking interpretability. To address this issue, we propose a Precipitation Nowcasting Using Diffusion Transformer with Causal Attention model. Our model leverages Transformer and combines causal attention mechanisms to es- tablish spatiotemporal queries between conditional information (causes) and forecast results (results). This design enables the model to effectively capture long-term dependencies, allowing forecast results to maintain strong causal relationships with input conditions over a wide range of time and space. We explore four variants of spatiotemporal information interactions for DTCA, demonstrating that global spatiotemporal labeling interactions yield the best performance. In addition, we intro- duce a Channel-To-Batch shift operation to further enhance the modelâ€™s ability to represent complex rainfall dynamics.
